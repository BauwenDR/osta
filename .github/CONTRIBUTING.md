## How to build
### Required programs
In order to build the app make sure you have the following installed:
- NodeJS + NPM
- Java 17 (Android does not support JDK 21 yet)
- Gradle (or an IDE with build in gradle tools)

### Installing
In case the Ionic framework has not been installed, install this first
```bash
npm install --global @ionic/cli
```

#### Running in webbrowser
Run the following command, a browser window should open automatically. If this does not happen, navigate to http://localhost:8100
```bash
npm run web
```

#### Running on Android
Before building for Android make sure you have a compatible Android device (Android 5.5 or higher) connected. 
Before running the following make sure the connected device is also in debug mode.
```bash
npm run android
```
